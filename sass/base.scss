/**
 * @file base.scss
 *   The Base stylesheet contains almost exclusively single element selectors;
 *   but it could include attribute selectors, pseudo-class selectors, child
 *   selectors or sibling selectors. Essentially, a base style says that
 *   wherever this element is on the page, it should look like this.
 *
 *   Base can also be used for basic styles that don't map well to HTML
 *   elements. For example, you might have background color classes in this
 *   file.
